            Netflix is a subscription-based streaming service that allows our members to watch TV shows and movies on an internet-connected device.   

        Depending on your plan, you can also download TV shows and movies to your iOS, Android, or Windows 10 device and watch without an internet connection.
        
        If you're already a member and would like to learn more about using Netflix, visit Getting started with Netflix.
